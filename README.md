# Frontend Practice Projects (HTML, CSS, JS)

This repository contains a collection of small frontend design projects I built during the early stages of my web development journey. These were created purely for learning and practicing core frontend skills including HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.

## Purpose

I started this repository when I began learning web development. Each mini-project here reflects my understanding and hands-on practice of various UI elements, layouts, and simple interactions. These projects helped me build a solid foundation and confidence in frontend development.

## What’s Inside?

- Simple homepages and landing pages
- CSS-based layouts using Flexbox and Grid
- Basic JavaScript interactions (e.g. navbar toggles, modals)
- Responsive designs for mobile and desktop
- No frameworks – pure HTML, CSS, and JS

## Skills Practiced

- Semantic HTML structure
- Styling with CSS (Box model, Flexbox, Grid)
- Responsive design techniques (Media queries)
- Basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Project organization and file structuring

## How to Use

You can clone or download this repository and open any project folder in your browser or code editor to explore the code and UI.
