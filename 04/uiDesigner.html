                    Figma is a cloud-based design tool primarily used for UI/UX design. It has gained significant popularity among designers and developers for its collaborative features and ease of use.
                    <h3 class="employee-intro">Importance of Figma in Web Development:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>Collaboration:</b>Figma allows multiple users to work on the same design file simultaneously, making it ideal for team projects. This real-time collaboration eliminates the need for constant file exchanges and ensures that everyone is on the same page.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                            <b>Cloud-Based Accessibility:</b>Being cloud-based, Figma allows access from any device with an internet connection, making it highly convenient for remote teams or freelancers. This also ensures that the latest version of the design is always available to everyone involved.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                            <b>Prototyping and Interaction Design:</b>Figma includes powerful prototyping tools that allow designers to create interactive and animated prototypes. This helps in visualizing how a website or app will behave before actual development begins, making it easier to spot issues and gather feedback.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                            <b>Design System Management:</b>Figma supports the creation and management of design systems. Teams can create a consistent set of components, colors, fonts, and other assets that can be reused across projects, ensuring design consistency and speeding up the design process.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                            <b>Developer Handoff:</b>Figma simplifies the handoff process to developers by providing detailed design specifications and CSS code snippets. Developers can inspect elements directly in Figma, which reduces miscommunication and helps in accurately translating designs into code.
