                    <h3>SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:</h3>
                    SQL is the standard language for managing and querying relational databases. It is used to store, retrieve, update, and manage data within a database system. In web development, SQL databases are essential for handling structured data, enabling developers to create dynamic, data-driven applications. Their value lies in their ability to organize and manipulate large amounts of data efficiently, ensuring that web applications can handle complex queries and provide reliable performance.

These technologies are fundamental in backend development, allowing developers to build, manage, and scale dynamic web applications with robust data management and efficient server-side logic.
